# COVID-19-Telegram-bot
A Telegram bot to get latest progress on COVID-19

## Architecture

The project is written with on Spring Boot. No Telegram library, framework or whatsoever is used in this project.
All the telegram integration is done through direct REST calls.

## How to set up the project

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11

### Run in local

Follow the steps to get it run in local.

#### Add tokens to `application.properties`

Set Telegram token in `application.properties`. 

Or alternatively export them as environment variable. For example,

```bash
$ export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=[telegram_token]
```

#### Run the application

Run the project in console,

```bash
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Run Ngrok

Download Ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download) and run it as follow,

```bash
$ ./ngrok http 8080
```

#### Update Telegram hook

Update the bot hook using `hook-update.sh`.

Before running the script, export the following environment variables,

```bash
$ export URL=[ngrok_url]
$ export TOKEN=[bot_token]
```

And finally run the script,

```bash
$ ./hook_update.sh
```

### Mimic production environment

To mimic the production environment, run the project with the `production` profile as follows,

```bash
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pproduction 
```

### Production deployment

To deploy the project to production, ensure the following environment variable is exported,

```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE = production
```

The rest of the process is more or less similar to run the project in local.


## Important notes

- In production profile, swagger-ui is disabled.
- Only API calls that come from Telegram servers are accepted, the rest is ignored, see `SecurityConfig.java`.
